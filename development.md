# Development Document

We are accepting PRs for new benchmarks. Please read this document carefully before you contribute your benchmark.

## Project Brief

This subsection introduces core frameworks and interfaces in this project and how developers are advised to utilize them.

### Pipeline

- `eval_anything/pipeline/base_task.py` provides the entire process from reading the evaluation parameters to saving the evaluation results. Do not change this file.

### Benchmark

- `eval_anything/benchmark/text-to-text/gsm8k/eval.py` inherits from the `T2TBenchmark` base class in `t2t_benchmark.py`. The code adapts to text-to-text benchmark evaluation processes, including reading benchmark configurations, loading datasets, running model inference and evaluation, and saving results. You can rewrite some functions in this file.

- `eval_anything/benchmark/text-to-text/gsm8k/configs.yaml` contains various benchmark configurations.

### Dataloader

- `eval_anything/dataloader/t2t_dataloader.py` inherits from the `BaseDataLoader` base class in  `base_dataloader.py`. It implements the reading and splicing of text-to-text evaluation data.
  - `eval_anything/dataloader/mm_dataloader.py`: inherits from the `BaseDataLoader` base class in `base_dataloder.py`.  It implements the reading and splicing of multimodal evaluation data.

- `eval_anything/dataloader/format_mm_dataset.py` implements the preprocessing of multimodal datasets for subsequent data loading, given the high complexity of multimodal data.

### Inference

- `eval_anything/models`: Various backend inferences are implemented under this path.

### Evaluation

- `eval_anything/evaluate_tools/metrics.py` contains commonly used metric calculation. We recommend you add your new metrics here rather than in the benchmark separately.
- `eval_anything/evaluate_tools/t2t_tools.py` integrates common evaluation tools such as regular expression matching and judgment of similarity, etc. New tools should be integrated in an object-oriented manner and considering the versatility of the tools.

### Utils

- `utils.py`: Common toolkits for project development.

- `data_type.py`: Common data types for data transfer between different modules

- `cache_manager.py`: Cache mechanisms

- `regiser.py`: Commonly used registry（template, metric, benchmark...）

- `logger.py`: Log mechanisms

- `mm_data_manager`: The format conversion and conversation compilation of various modal data

## General Guidelines

1. Create a directory under the `benchmarks` folder
   - Write a configuration file `configs.yaml`. Here is an [example](eval_anything/benchmarks/text_to_text/gsm8k/configs.yaml).
   - Develop `eval.py` after inheriting from the corresponding benchmark base class.
2. (Optional) Create `metrics.py` and `tools.py` and make registers for new metrics and evaluation tools. Here is an [example](eval-anything/eval_anything/benchmarks/text_to_text/TruthfulQA).
3. Configure your evaluation tasks in `eval_anything/configs/evaluate.yaml`.
4. Run `eval_anything/scripts/run.sh` to test your benchmark.

## Configuring Any-to-text Datasets

When developing multimodal datasets, you may encounter difficulty to unify the loading methods of multimodal data. Please follow the steps below for dataset preprocessing:

1. Register your dataset in `dataloader/format_mm_dataset.py`
2. Process benchmark-specific key-value pairs and construct prompts in `dataloader/format_mm_dataset.py` with predefined PromptBuilders. You may customize your own PromptBuilder in the `_to_InferenceInput` method if necessary.
3. Convert images, audios and videos to `base64` with `utility classes` in `utils/mm_data_manager.py` for conversation embedding.
4. Use the utility classes in `utils/mm_data_manager.py` to customize the form of conversation for this  task. For example, `ImageManager.prompt_to_conversation` implements the conversation construction for common graphic and text inputs.
5. The inference and evaluation part is the same as introduced in [General Guidelines](##General Guidelines)

## Pre-commit

This project uses pre-commit to ensure code quality and consistency. Pre-commit will automatically run the configured inspection tool before each commit.

### Installation

1. Install pre-commit

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Initialize pre-commit in the root directory

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Usage

Before each code submission, pre-commit will run automatically. It is also possible to run the check manually:

```bash
# check all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# check temporary files
pre-commit run
```

If there are unsolved problems, pre-commit will prevent the commit and display error messages. After fixing the problem, re-add the file and submit it:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
git push
```

To skip the check and commit directly:

```bash
git commit -m "MESSAGE" --no-verify
```

### Inspection tools

The following inspection tools are configured for this project:

- **pre-commit-hooks**: Basic file checks (line end Spaces, file endings, YAML/TOML formats, large file checks, etc.)
- **isort**: Sorting Python import statements
- **black**: Python code formatting
- **pyupgrade**: Upgrade the Python syntax to a later version
- **autoflake**: Remove unused imports and variables
- **codespell**: spell check

See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for detailed configuration.

## Tips

- Please follow *Occam's Razor* principle in development and minimize the rewriting of existing functions
- please add new dependency libraries needed in `pyproject.toml`.
- We welcome any suggestions regarding current base classes!
